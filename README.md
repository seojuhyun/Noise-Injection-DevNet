## Noise-Injection-DevNet
A TensorFlow-based implementation of DevNet with noise-injected anomaly detection for highly imbalanced datasets.  
This project is part of a research submission to **The Korean Institute of Broadcast and Media Engineers 2025 (KIBME 2025)**.


## ðŸš€ Overview
This repository implements a deep anomaly detection framework based on Deviation Networks (DevNet), enhanced with synthetic noise injection to address highly imbalanced datasets.  
The model is trained using a modified deviation-based loss function and supports multiple network depths (1, 2, 4, or 6 layers).  
Experimental results demonstrate improved robustness and precision in detecting rare anomalies across various domains.
